List of Feedback Received;

Volume slider is too big and redundant, should be off to the side or invisible 

The change of midi numbers is redundant, rename it to just simply octave 1, octave 2, octave 3

The key stays yellow even after they key is done playing

There are no instructions in how to use the piano, a clear instructions page is needed, the keys should be labeled

Piano keys do not match up to keyboard, it’s hard to play

Interface colors don’t match well, blue and white and black doesn’t go well together

The fonts can be more elegant and neat

There’s lag in the volume slider, and pressing of the piano keys
