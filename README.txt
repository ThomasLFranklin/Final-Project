3. Known Issues in 1.0 & Intended Fixes

Lag is a well-known issue of this program. As we are all relatively
novice programmers, some of our code has not entirely been optimized for
performance. However, the code should work as intended, as this program was
developed with process and function in mind, with not as much emphasis on
performance.

 * Keys will not hold notes when held down unless the default Key Repeat
   option is turned off in Windows. See "the Windows Configuration GUide.pdf"
   for instructions on how to disable this for improved performance.
 
We are oprimismistic that we may add in the future:
 * Support for our program to include a recording feature.
 * A metronome to assist with this.
